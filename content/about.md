## Background
With a strong foundation in web development, I have honed my skills in creating dynamic and responsive web applications. My journey began with a fascination for how websites are built and has grown into a career dedicated to building secure and efficient web solutions.

## Skills

- **Backend Development:** Node.js, Express
- **Static Site Generators:** Hugo
- **Security Practices:** HTTPS, Content Security Policy, Input Validation
- **Tools and Technologies:** Git, Docker, Netlify, CloudFlare

## Current Focus
I am currently working on projects that bridge the gap between frontend development and cybersecurity. My goal is to develop secure web applications that are not only functional and user-friendly but also robust against potential threats.

## Hobbies and Interests
When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest in cybersecurity trends, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good book on software development.
